# Arctic Wolf Spring4Shell Deep Scan

The Arctic Wolf Spring4Shell Deep Scan is designed to detect Java application 
packages subject to 
[CVE-2022-22965](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965).

## Background

Java applications that contain a vulnerable version of the Spring Framework
and that are running on Java version 9 or greater may be subject to 
CVE-2022-22965.

This script searches the system for:

- Vulnerable Java Applications: Java applications that contain a version of the 
  Spring Framework that has not been patched (5.3.0 - 5.3.17, or < 5.2.20) to 
  remediate this vulnerability. The script explores Java packaging formats (jar,
  war, ear) to detect Spring inside of packages or packages within packages
  (nested packages).
- Java 9+: instances of Java (JRE or JDK) version 9 or greater. 

Systems containing vulnerable Java applications and Java 9+ may not be
vulnerable. This script does not attempt to determine whether the vulnerable
application is currently running, whether it is remotely-accessible or whether
it runs on Java 9+.

For remediation steps, contact the vendor of each vulnerable Java application.


## Scan Results

Each scan will have one of the following results:

- PASS: all Java applications detected were scanned and no vulnerable 
  applications were found.
- FAIL: one or more vulnerable Java applications were found and Java 9+ was
  found on the system. See output and JSON for paths. If the script was unable
  to scan any applications, they will also be listed in the output and JSON.
  Note: if vulnerable applications are found and Java is found, but the Java
  version cannot be determined, this will also result in FAIL.
- WARN: one or more vulnerable Java applications were found but Java 9+ was
  not found on the system. See output and JSON for paths. If the script was 
  unable to scan any applications, they will also be listed in the output and 
  JSON.
- UNKNOWN: no vulnerable Java applications were detected, but the script was
  not able to detect all scanned applications. See output and JSON for paths.
- ERROR: the script encountered an error and was unable to complete. See output
  for details.


## If You Find Vulnerable Applications

We recommend the following steps:

- Confirm the vulnerable application does not run on Java 9+
- Contact the vendor or application owner of each affected application for
  remediation steps

### Windows

#### Important Notes

- This script requires .NET 4.5+
- This script should be run in a privileged context (i.e. as administrator)
- This script may use up to a single CPU and run for 1-20 minutes depending 
  on the size of the disk being search and the volume of files. Please test
  to assess resource impact and consider setting process priority if needed.

To run, open Command (cmd.exe) as administrator:

```
> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -f spring4shell_deep_scan.ps1
```

By default, all fixed drives will be searched. Specify a search_root as follows:

```
> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -f spring4shell_deep_scan.ps1 -search_root C:\START_HERE
```

Results will be written to a file in the current working directory as follows:

```
spring4shell_deep_scan.output.<hostname>.<timestamp>.json
```

To specify a file name for the output file, provide as a paramater as follows:

```
> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -f spring4shell_deep_scan.ps1 -output_filepath FILENAME_HERE.json
```

This can take several minutes. Ctrl-c to abort.


### Linux/macOS

#### Important Notes

- This script should be run in a privileged context (i.e. as root or using 
  sudo) so it can access the entire system.
- This script may use up to a single CPU and run for 1-20 minutes depending 
  on the size of the disk being search and the volume of files. Please test
  to assess resource impact and consider using `nice` if needed.

To run, open command prompt:

```
$ sudo sh spring4shell_deep_scan.sh
```

By default, all fixed drives will be searched. Specify a search_root as follows:

```
$ sudo sh spring4shell_deep_scan.sh /START_HERE
```

Results will be written to a file in the current working directory as follows:

```
spring4shell_deep_scan.output.<hostname>.<timestamp>.json
```

To specify a file name for the output file, provide as a paramater as follows:

```
$ sudo sh spring4shell_deep_scan.sh /START_HERE FILENAME_HERE.json
```
     
This can take several minutes. Ctrl-c to abort.
